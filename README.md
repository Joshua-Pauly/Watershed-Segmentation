The purpose of watershed segmentation is to delineate and identify boundaries between distinct objects or regions within an image, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of image analysis. This method simulates the process of a watershed filling with water, where contours are detected at points where different regions converge.Watershed segmentation is commonly used in medical imaging to separate and identify different anatomical structures, within complex images like MRI or CT scans.

This project was to demonstrated the capabilities of watershed segmentation on a sunflower field.

Listed are the steps taken:
1)	Grayscale the image. 
2)	Gradient magnitude as a segmentation function. This will show boundaries of objects
3)	Mark foreground of objects: I used â€œdisk Strel function with a radius of 12 as described in the assignment.
4)	Opening by reconstruction using imerode and imreconstruct
5)	Opening-closing by reconstruction using imdilate, imreconstruct, and imcomplement. This removes small blemishes without affecting shape.
6)	Regional Maxima of opening-closing by reconstruction. Obtains foreground marker
7)	Superimpose step 6 on grayscale image
8)	By using imclose and imrode, and bwareopen it cleans the edges of the marker blobs. This step is labeled Modified Regional Maxima Superimposed on original Image in the picture below.
9)	Compute background marker using imbinarize. Labeled threshold opening closing by reconstruction
10)	Compute watershed ridge lines using bwdist and watershed.
11)	Compute watershed transform of segmentation function using imimposemin to modify the gradient magnitude image so that regional minima occur at foreground and background marker pixels. 
12)	For visualization overlay the markers and object boundaries and superimpose on original image. 
13)	Display the label matrix as a color image using label2rgb
14)	Using that last image we can overlay on the original image with low transparency to get the Colored Labels Superimposed Transparency on original Image, Image.
